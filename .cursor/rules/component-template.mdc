This rule defines the structure for React components:

React components should follow this layout:

- Props interface at the top
- Component as named export
- Prefer the use of const variables rather than function() definitions for React components
- Styles should be in their respective components, unless the component grows large (over 350+ lines of code). If the file has too many lines of code, styles should then be placed in it's own styles file with the naming convention `<component>.styles.tsx`
- When importing components, always use the aliases found in tsconfig.app.json rather than relative imports, unless it is in a child directory to the current file or otherwise suggested
