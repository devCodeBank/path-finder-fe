# Handling SVGs guidelines

This project is currently using vite-plugin-svgr v4.3.0

When given an SVG to import into the app:

- Optimise the SVG with SVGO.
- Place them in the src/assets folder, unless asked otherwise.
- If the SVG in question is stated to be a static icon, place it in the public/ directory.
- Prefer using SVGs as a react component if either asked to use an SVG or when an SVG import is needed, unless it is not possible to do so.
- All SVGs should use `currentColor` instead of hardcoded colors
- Replace attributes like `stroke="#666666"` with `stroke="currentColor"`
- Replace attributes like `fill="#666666"` with `fill="currentColor"`
